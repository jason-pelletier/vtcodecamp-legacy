  "description": "Technology user groups are a great way to network, learn, share your expertise, meet experts, find job opportunities, and get help when needed. Don't have a local user group focused on the programming language or technology that you use? Start one! Learn what it takes to get started and how much of a commitment it is to organize. This will be a heavily interactive session so come prepared with plenty of questions, or, if you already organize a user group then come prepared with helpful tips to share.",
