  "description": "This session will cover an Introduction to using Twitter Bootstrap in ASP.NET.\n\nTwitter bootstrap is a great, open-source front-end framework for designing and developing sleek web applications. It's been out for a while, but if you haven't had a chance to take it for a spin, this session will be a great launching pad. We'll cover some of the basic principles of responsive design, and discuss how Bootstrap (or any front end framework) can make designing a modern UI much easier.\n\nKyle is currently 20th on the top twitter-bootstrap answerers on StackOverflow of all time. But don't just take his word for it: [data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/185479/](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/185479/)",
