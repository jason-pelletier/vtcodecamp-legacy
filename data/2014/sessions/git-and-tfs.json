  "description": "When you start a new job & they're using TFS, do you wish they were using Git INSTEAD? Why don't YOU use them TOGETHER? The git-tfs bridge enables the best of both worlds: TFS for devs who (like I used to say) \"have no interest in learning a command-line tool,\" while enabling those of us who have seen Git solve version control challenges previously assumed unsolvable, to use our new Git love. This is a level 200 talk (meaning if you've never used Git, this talk is not for you... yet. Go to a \"what is Git?\" talk first. We will not cover the time-consuming \"what is a dvcs?\" topics and such). If you've used both TFS & Git, but only separately, or want to know even MORE about using both together, this talk is for you.",
