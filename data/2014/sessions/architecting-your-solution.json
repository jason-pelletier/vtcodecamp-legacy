  "description": "Every project starts with someone saying, \"I need THIS done.\" They're commonly able to functionally define what \"THIS\" means, but often aren't aware of the VAST majority of necessary non-functional requirements.\n\nTheir short list of requirements may encompass less than 50% of the overall scope of a project.
