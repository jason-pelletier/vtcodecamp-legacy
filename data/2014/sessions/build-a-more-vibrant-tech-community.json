  "title": "Build A More Vibrant Tech Community",
  "description": "Learning to code is quickly becoming a necessary skill, but our community needs help to ensure that resources are reaching the people who need these skills most. The explosive growth of Girl Develop It in Burlington has proven that merely by inviting an underrepresented sub sector, you'll find that if you build it, they will come. But GDI is not enough, more resources must become available to bring in wider diversity, reach out to the more rural areas of Vermont, and also to teach children. This is an imperative investment to ensure a vibrant tech future for Vermont. This talk will review how you can contribute and what can be done to build and maintain a wider and more inclusive tech community. It's easier than you think!",
