  "title": "Beyond the Box: Distributed Programming with ZeroMQ",
  "description": "As fast and powerful as the PC has become, it's still not enough. Modern computing demands moving code up and out â€” from threads to processes to machines to clusters. To do so intelligently requires solid tools and flexible techniques. In this example-driven talk, you'll learn how ZeroMQ, a library for distributed computing, provides the means to rise up to the challenges of modern computing. In particular, we will explore how a language-agnostic, pattern-based approach to message exchange may be used to deliver sophisticated and compelling distributed programming solutions.",
