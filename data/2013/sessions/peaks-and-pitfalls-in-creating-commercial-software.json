  "description": "Kendall Miller, Co-founder of Gibraltar Software (A Baltimore-based Independent Software Vendor) pulls back the curtain and talks about the challenges and difficult decisions that come along with creating a business around commercial software.\n\n * Creating Product Strategy — One of these three doors is the path to greatness, the other two go nowhere. Guess which.\n * Connecting with Customers — Trying to not be the best product no one ever heard of.\n * Finding the Right Talent — Collecting the team to knock it out of the park\n\nWe'll go through real examples from the history of our software products — things that have worked out and things that have gone awry. Sometimes comical, sometimes tragic — it's never boring when you're building your reputation and your company.",
