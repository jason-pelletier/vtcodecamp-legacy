  "description": "REST is now the standard method of interacting between systems, however many service implementations are still stuck in a SOAP style approach. In this talk I will present the Richardson Maturity Model, how conditional PUTs and GETs can be used in concurrent system and finish up with discussing Varnish. Varnish is a reverse proxy which has many features that help to accelerate your REST services even when you clients are simple.",
