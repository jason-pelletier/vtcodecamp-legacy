  "title": "Beyond \"ng-hello-world\": Building Real World Web Apps with AngularJS",
  "description": "AngularJS is an open-source front-end MVC framework from Google for dynamic web apps. On top of the customary MVC features, AngularJS has a rich vocabulary of components including services for code sharing, filters for view layer data transformation, and directives for extending HTML. At [Dealer.com](http://www.dealer.com/), we recently built a centralized remote configuration service and we chose AngularJS to handle the user interface concerns. This talk will provide a high-level introduction to AngularJS, discuss the front-end challenges we faced, and describe how we solved those problems with AngularJS.",
