  "description": "There seem to be a lot of .NET developers taking a solid look at Ruby on Rails recently (and some are jumping ship on .NET) and I have to wonder if the reason is ASP.NET MVC. There are a lot of similarities between the two and in this session I will give an intro to Ruby on Rails from a ASP.NET MVC developers prospective and how they are similar. I took my first look at Rails several years ago, but it was after working with ASP.NET MVC, that I really \"discovered\" what Rails had to offer. I will share my learning process from ASP.NET MVC to Rails and how working with Rails has helped me be a better overall developer.",
