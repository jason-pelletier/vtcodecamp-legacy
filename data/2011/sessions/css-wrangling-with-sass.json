  "description": "Sass is an extension of CSS3 that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. (With a little help from Ruby) This talk will cover an overview of what Sass is, how to get it, run it, and use it, and show some examples of its magic.",
