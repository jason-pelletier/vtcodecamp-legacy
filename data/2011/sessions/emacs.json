  "description": "\"Emacs: a great OS, shame it's missing a decent editor\". Emacs is indeed a powerful platform for running a whole set applications that serve to enhance its (actually quite awesome!) editing capabilities into a powerful environment for doing nearly any task. From quickly editing text files to intensely editing source code to building projects to checking email, browsing the web, IM/IRC, twitter,controlling multimedia, and organizing your tasks lists â€¦ emacs really is a \"great\" OS. Grounded in the presenter's everyday usage, we'll explore both those mentioned applications, but also talk about the powerful core editing capabilities that make everything come together in a highly functional environment.
