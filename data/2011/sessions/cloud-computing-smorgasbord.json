  "description": "Though it's been around for several years, \"cloud computing\" is rapidly evolving, and a crisp, universal definition continues to elude us. In this session, we'll focus not on definitions but on the concrete: the services you should look for in a cloud provider. Although the content will highlight the service offerings of Windows Azure; we'll also include discussion of other cloud vendor offerings in a compare/contrast fashion.",
