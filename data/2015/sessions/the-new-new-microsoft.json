  "description": "Running .NET apps on OS X and Linux has been possible for many years thanks to the Mono project. Now, with the brand new — and fully open source — CoreCLR and .NET Execution Environment (DNX), OS X and Linux are supported by Microsoft as first-class .NET platforms. In this session, we’ll explore the new DNVM, DNU and DNX command-line tools by building a simple ASP.NET 5 app. We’ll do this on OS X in the new slimmed down Visual Studio Code editor — with no .sln or .csproj files in sight. We’ll show how git, node, npm, and gulp work together with VS Code to create a simple, clean, and fast development environment. For bonus points, we’ll deploy our app to a Docker container running on Linux in Azure.\n\nFamiliarity with .NET is helpful, but not necessary.",
