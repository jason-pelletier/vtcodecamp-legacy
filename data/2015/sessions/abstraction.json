  "description": "So you inherited some code. Do you know what the programmer was trying to say? Was the programming language powerful enough to help? Are you relying on decaying comments and English-like naming to compensate? Denotational semantics is the ultimate powertool in cutting through the syntactic clutter of programming languages and careless thinking. We'll get warmed up with a look at intuitionist logic and the Curry-Howard isomorphism. We'll get up to cruising altitude with dependent types. Then we'll finish up with denotational semantics and see how it can give you x-ray vision through that jumble of a program.",
