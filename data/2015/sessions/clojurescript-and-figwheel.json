Type. Now do it on multiple browsers or multiple devices.\n\nThis is clearly an inhumane way to write software, and the quality of our programs suffers as a result. Figwheel offers a glimpse into the value live-reloading a web application without losing the application state, or altering the application state without reloading the application.",
