In addition to conducting research, Amy works across 18 release trains to bring user-centered thinking and methodologies to product, design, and engineering teams. In a previous life, Amy conducted neuroscience research and taught undergraduate psychology courses. Amy is a bit of a Luddite, but she believes this is advantageous for doing UX research because it keeps her grounded in the problem space rather than the solution space.",
