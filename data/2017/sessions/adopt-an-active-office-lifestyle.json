  "title": "Adopt an Active Office Lifestyle",
  "description": "Do you find yourself sitting in an office chair for hours on end, hunching into that awful turtle posture? Itâ€™s time to break out of your shell, get out of your chair more often, and adopt a more active office lifestyle. This session will discuss research that explains the downsides to sedentary behavior, cover why improving your everyday office routine is vital, and provide simple tools to do so. An essential element to a new office lifestyle is the habit: we will learn the components of a habit and how to create a new habit or modify an existing one. This session was developed and presented for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) conference in 2016 which draws over 11,000 female engineers annually.",
