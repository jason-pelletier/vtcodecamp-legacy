  "description": "Using the Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution and Qt application framework, we will demonstrate a theoretical app platform for an IoT device. This theoretical app platform will be modeled after production systems using open source software in the automotive and medical industries. Weâ€™ll explore the rationale for creating such a platform, then briefly introduce the Qt application framework, and create an example app from scratch. Finally, we will package and deploy this app to our theoretical device for a live demo.",
