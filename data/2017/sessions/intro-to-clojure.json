  "description": "An introduction to programming with Clojure using the Leinengen REPL. We'll talk about how LISP languages work, some basic functional concepts, and how to implementthem in Clojure. I'm calling it 100 level because it'll be intro to Clojure, but overall it's not a beginner language, imho.",
