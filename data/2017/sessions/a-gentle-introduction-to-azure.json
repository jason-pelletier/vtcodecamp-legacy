  "description": "Looking for a hard-core deep diving into using all 30+ Azure services to build applications that are globally scalable, low-latency, use big data, and support blockchain?\n\nWell, this isn't that talk.\n\nIn this talk we'll have a more measured look at just a few key Azure services. We'll see how to quickly and practically build applications, APIs, and workflows that are easily deployed and managed. In our journey, we'll touch on Azure Active Directory, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Websites, Logic Apps, and maybe one or two other technologies.\n\nBy the end, you'll see Azure through a highly practical light!",
