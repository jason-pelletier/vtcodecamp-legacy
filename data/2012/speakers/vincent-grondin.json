I was involved in many enterprise projects for large corporations like Desjardins, Domtar, Cascades and Alcoa but I was also part of a few projects for various government branches. I like to learn new technologies related to .NET, use the new tools that are designed for .NET and I love to share it all with my peers. Yes, I'm a confessed .NET addict and I'm currently working at Fujitsu as a Senior Consultant and received an MVP award in C# from Microsoft.",
