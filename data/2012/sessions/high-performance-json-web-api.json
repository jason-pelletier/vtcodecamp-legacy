  "description": "Aimed at PHP/Ruby/Python programmers, this talk aims to show the power and simplicity of both Haskell and the web framework written in it: Yesod.\n\nWe will have a brief overview of Yesod, walk through the building of a scaffolded application as we build a simple, yet very elegant web application for serving JSON data to an external application.\n\nWith time permitting, we will cover Hamlet template files by giving an HTML representation to our data.",
