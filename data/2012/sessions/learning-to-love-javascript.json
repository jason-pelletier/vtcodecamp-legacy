  "description": "With all the libraries out there to help in client-side development, I found myself wanting to dive solely into JavaScript.This talk will take attendees through the basics of JavaScript, focusing on syntax, closures, datatypes, prototypal inheritance and events. I hope to also talk about the importance of JavaScript today, given how many frameworks exist and what can be done with things like WebGL, Canvas and WebSockets.",
