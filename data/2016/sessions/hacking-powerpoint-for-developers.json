  "description": "Effective presentations are hard. When presenting, many developers show a few traditional bullet-point slides and discount the usage of PowerPoint or Keynote, and then resort to unpredictable live demos. From a developer's perspective, I will highlight simple, but usually overlooked, features within PowerPoint, and some conventions you can apply to your next presentation. I will also demonstrate how PowerPoint can be used for Story Boards and as an alternative to Camtasia for recorded demos, as well as a replacement for a live demo. It is time for you to revisit the powerful and easy to use capabilities of PowerPoint.",
