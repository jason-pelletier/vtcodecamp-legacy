  "description": "Musings on the intersections of Computation, the Nature of Reality, Consciousness, Abstract Models and what is knowable.\n\nIn this presentation I will attempt to discuss questions of computation; is the universe computable?; is consciousness computable?; and other ideas. My motivationis simply because it interests and fascinates me.\n\nIt will be broad and rambling. I hope it will interest and spur your fascination with this multifaceted area â€“ one that we work and play in everyday.",
