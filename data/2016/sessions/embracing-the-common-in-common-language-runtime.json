  "description": "One of the undervalued strengths of .NET/Mono is the ability to mix-and-match many different languages. And yet, developing libraries for polyglot consumption is a little-known craft. In this example-laden talk (drawn from 18 years of professional experience) we'll learn some of the tools, techniques, and mindset needed to deliver high-quality libraries which are a joy to consume from multiple CLR languages.\n\n(Note: this session assumes a day-to-day familiarity with .NET or Mono, though not necessarily in more than one language. Also, the discussion will be limited to languages \"in the box\" with Visual Studioâ€¦ sorry, Cobol.NET fans.)",
