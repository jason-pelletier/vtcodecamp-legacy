All developers work with protocols and abstractions built on top of TCP, so learning how to peak under the hood can be invaluable when troubleshooting.\n\nWe'll measure HTTP response times without adding code to your application, inspect the contents of incoming requests (in production!) without attaching a debugger, and more.",
